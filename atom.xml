        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Loved you with my heart,<br>
my soul and my conscience.<br>
Loved you with all I had,<br>
sort of love that was world blind.</p>
<p>Loved you with my head,<br>
my respect and my loyality.<br>
Loved you with every breeze,<br>
that touched your ideal personality.</p>
<p>Loved you as you are,<br>
you was and you have always been.<br>
Loved you as you would be,<br>
all possible shades that you could be in.</p>
<p>Loved you with my truth,<br>
my life and my genuine.<br>
Loved you with my silence,<br>
my words that are living.</p>
<p>Loved you in my lows,<br>
my highs and my extemes.<br>
Loved you in each mood swings,<br>
your love my sweet dream.</p>
<p>Loved you such love,<br>
undefinable and unspoken.<br>
Loved you such love,<br>
that remained untaken!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>From childhood's hour I have not been</strong><br>
As others were -- I have not seen<br>
As others saw -- I could not bring<br>
My passions from a common spring --<br>
From the same source I have not taken<br>
My sorrow -- I could not awaken<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone --<br>
And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --<br>
Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn<br>
Of a most stormy life -- was drawn<br>
From ev'ry depth of good and ill<br>
<code>The mystery which binds me still --</code>From the torrent, or the fountain --<br>
From the red cliff of the mountain --<br>
From the sun that 'round me roll'd<br>
In its autumn tint of gold --<br>
From the lightning in the sky<br>
As it pass'd me flying by --<br>
From the thunder, and the storm --<br>
And the cloud that took the form<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
Of a demon in my view --</p>

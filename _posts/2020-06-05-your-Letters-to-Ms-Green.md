Dear Ms Green,

Its been a while since we last spoke. 

I would shamelessly confess that I have missed you, although not as much as you would have wanted me to. I apologize for that. 

It has been pretty busy. And sometimes when I get overwhelmed with emotions and situations, I often converse with you in my head, and at many times I thought of sitting down and writing to you, but time didn’t forgive such moments to me. And now finally when it has, I am glad that it has.

Ms Green, how have you been? Have you been able to find answers to the questions we used to be puzzled over. I hope you’ll enlighten me too if any of those quests has been conquered.

Anyway, something strange happened yesterday. I was dead tired, as usual, when the alarm struck, and although everything in my body had been screaming to get up, the will to leave the bed was just not there, and the excuse for an extra five minutes of sleep made me super late, to the point where I had only fifteen minutes at hand to reach the hospital. Taking the bus wasn’t an option, so I got one of those rent bikers to take me to the hospital so I could reach before the attendance for the day was barred. 

The biker was an extremely polite man, in his thirties perhaps, and when I told him I was late for duty, he took it too seriously. The zig-zag curves he started on were perhaps the most exciting and dangerous minutes I have experienced in my life. Now, I know that you must be judging my lifestyle based on the aforementioned statement, but Ms Green, I think you already know the kind of dull life I have always had and shall always be in. 

Anyways, at one of the sharp turns that he made, our motorbike slid and almost lost balance, and a car running straight at a questionable speed at this early hour of the morning screeched to a sudden halt just inches from my knees. We could have lost balance, I could have fallen on the road, the car could have run over me, the motorbike or the tires of the car could have crushed my skull, they could have run over my legs, I could have been dragged on the road with my legs still stuck to the motorbike with my skin grazing the rough cemented road for minutes, or maybe a million other crazily painful things could have happened. 

My head, for the next ten minutes, or thirty, I am not really sure, was in a haze, in the possibility of what could have been. The entire morning, I kept on going back to the incidence, and thinking over and over again, what if I had died.

Ms Green, I am not afraid of death. Well, that’s not really correct, I am very much frightened of the idea of death, to suddenly not be one day, to suddenly cease to exist. Especially as a person who doesn’t believe in an afterlife, death does scare me. But when I say I am not afraid, what I actually mean is that -  I get it. I accept it. The scary idea of not being able to finish everything, to suddenly disappear, to not be able to finish watching the whatever Netflix series I might would have started at the time, the idea of it – I accept it. 
But in the moment, when I was almost there, in a moment what could have been the “it” moment, there was only one thought that scared me. 

People say that in the last moments of your life, you go through your whole life in a moment. All the memories – true or false ones, lived or imagined ones, all thoughts that were ever born in your head, all of them they cross through you in that one last moment. But the first thing that came to me, Ms Green, were words I had kept in my head, hidden, repeated, revised, learnt, but had never said to him. I regret that the most Ms Green. To have not told him. 
And I am still here, very much alive, making new memories and living the dull life, with those words repeating/rephrasing in my head every night, and every morning, and every time I see him, and every time I think of him, which is more frequent than any other thought; those words they have become a living trauma. A wound I have been carrying with me which cannot be healed as the only cure is to speak them out to him, which won’t happen. I would not let it.

I know you pity me Ms Green, and I know that you wish me courage; I wish for it too. But I shall forever keep these words with me, with remorse, dying from them a thousand times. These words are sharp, and I shall forever choose to cut myself and forever bleed than to kill him with them.
You know that I cannot say it, Ms Green, you have always known. And I know that you wish as much as I do, that I could have.

A dull life with burden of secrets of someone else’s mistakes, such life – I wish for it to conclude soon.

Regards,
M

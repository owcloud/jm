Dear Ms Green,

	Thank you for calling me the other day. Although brief, the last conversation we had over the dead telephone was the most real conversation I have had in a long time.

	I hope you doing as well as you said you were.

	Something strange happened the other day, I could use the word “abhorrent” but not sure if it should be. I haven’t still figured out how to feel about the whole thing. If it was any other day, I would have said that I was angry, disgusted, ashamed, or scared even; but the truth is, my feelings about it are deeper than that. And the exact way I feel about it is still a bit confusing to me.

	It was exactly two days ago, my refrigerator had been empty for weeks and I had been postponing the trip to grocery shopping primarily because of my laziness, but also due to the constant exhaustive state I have lately been in. But I had run out of beer, so the grocery shopping had become indispensable at this point. I would describe to you my clothing and walk to the mall, but have decided that such information is neither necessary nor relevant to what happened next. 

	On my walk back to my apartment with both of my hands occupied with the huge plastic bags I was carrying from the mall, a car with tainted windows slowed down and the door to the back seats opened while parallel to me. Two men sitting with their pants down at their ankles and rubbing their cocks looked directly at my face. I looked at them, then at their hands, then at their cocks, back to their face – too confused to react. Honestly, I was stuck Ms Green, I didn’t know what to do – whether to scream, or swear at them, or run. A few moments passed as the men continued rubbing themselves off. When I realized I was just standing there gawking at their insolent act, I abruptly looked around to suddenly notice how completely empty the street was. I turned towards the path and quickened my pace, almost sprinting to my apartment. The car kept up with me with the back door still open, while the two men sneered with filthy words roaring out of their mouths. I could have told you what they said but I was too scared to take notice of it. I spotted a couple of people at the small vendor a few steps in front of me, and as soon as I saw them, I ran towards them. Apparently the car driver registered their presence too, and he suddenly sped up. But before they left my side, I felt thick goo over my shirt, and my hair. 

	The bunch of guys at the vendor must have understood what happened looking at my sweaty and panting appearance, because they offered to walk me to my apartment, and I don’t quite remember what exactly I told them, but I most definitely appreciated the offer more than anything else at the moment. 

	At home, in the mirror, I didn’t wish to look at myself. I took three showers that night and several others in the following days, as if the filth brewing within me could be washed off my skin. And I don’t have questions like “why would they do this, or what’s wrong with them,” because some people are just sick, and I know that. Sickness doesn’t need a reason but only a cause and whatever the cause isn’t my concern. My concern, Ms Green, is why am I not able to let this go.

	I have been stuck in those few seconds. And despite possessing an extremely weak memory, I can recall each instant vividly with the colors, the sound, and the smell, O the fucking smell steaming off that car and the semen in my hair, and the shrill of their laughter and the comments “bitch you’re hot” playing over and over again in my head as if something in it is broken, or as if some connection loose and it cannot seem to more further. I have lived that moment more than I have lived any other moment in my life, but I don’t know still how to exactly feel about it. 

	I obviously am angry, at the people who thought they could just do something like that to anybody, but surprisingly I am angry at myself more. I am angry that I didn’t react, or scream at them, or did not do a fucking thing, but just ran. I am angry at myself for getting stuck. With the way I have grown up, I am angry that I wasn’t prepared for anything like that. And to frustratingly add more, I am angry for feeling ashamed and disgusted at myself.

	Why, Ms Green, do I feel embarrassed when nothing in any of it was my fault or doing. Do I have to be ashamed for being a girl, or worse, do I need to be ashamed for being a “hot bitch”? Why do I feel disgusted for owning skin, and body parts? Why can’t I seem to wash it off me?

	When an act is done, intentionally or carelessly, for fun or with an intention to offend, planned or in the instant – the trauma and the string of questions that it brings with it afterwards is more haunting than the act itself. Whilst all minds are occupied with the offender and the possibilities of punishments that could justify, could we give perhaps a little more, if not equal, care to talk about the mental state of the victim sometime? Talking about it is a taboo and the general mentality believes than discussing it might further traumatize the offended, but can’t we see that not talking about it makes things worse?

	If everyone would openly discuss and can freely call the wrong out to be wrong, and if we could acknowledge the natural thoughts to be natural, I might not feel so confused then. I would feel okay to be disgusted and angry and scared. I wouldn’t be so confused, and the blame the ones that are to be blamed. And not myself. But we don’t do that. 

	And that’s why, Ms Green, I’d rather be in any other world than this one.

Regards,

M
